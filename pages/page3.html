   <h3 id="cl"><u>Coal</u></h3>
   <p><i>Coal is one of the most important primary fossil fuels, a solid carbon rich material
    that is usually brown or black and most often occurs in stratified sedimentary deposits.
    coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world.Coal seems 
    exist on every continent.The largest coal reserves are in the United States, Russia, 
    China, Australia, and India.Coal is very different from mineral rocks, which are Made
    of in-organic material.Coal is made of fragile plant matter, and undergoes many changes
    before it becomes the familiar black and shiny substance burned as fuels.Coal is ranked
    according to how much it has changed overtime.Hilt's Law states that the deeper the coal 
    seam, the higher its rank.At deeper depths, the material encounters greater temperatures
    and pressure, and more plant debris is transformed into carbon.Coal goes through different 
    phases of carbonization over millions of years, and can be found at all ages of development 
    in different parts of the world.In the United States, coal is mined in 25 states and three
    major regions.In the western coal Region, Wyoming is the top producer-about 40 percent of the
    coal mined in the country is extracted in the state.More than one third of the nation's coal 
    comes from the Appalachian coal region, which includes West Virginia,Virginia, Tennessee,and kentucky.
    Coal extracted from Texas in the interior Coal Region supplies mostly local markets.

   <h3 id="cmt"><u>Chromite</u></h3>
   <p><i>Chromite is the main source of the metal chromium, a metal used to induce hardness,
    toughness and chemical resistance in steel.It was named after it's chemical composition,
    chromium oxide.The mineral is brownish to black in color with a dark brown streak.Chromite can be 
    challenging to identify.Several properties must be considered to diffrentiate it from other metallic 
    ores.Hand specimen identification of chromite requires a consideration of:color specific gravity, luster
    and a characteristics of brown streak.The most important clue to identify chromite is its association 
    with ulta basic igneous rocks and metamorphic rock such as serpentinite.Chromite is sometimes slightly 
    magnetic.This can cause it to be confused with magnetite.Chromite and ilmenite have very similar properties.
    Careful observations of hardness,streak,and specific gravity are required to distinguish these minerals in 
    hand specimens.Chromite is usually massive or in the form of lenses and tubuler bodies, or it may be disseminated 
    as granules.It is sometimes found as a crystalline inclusion in diamond.When chromite ore is fused with sodium 
    carbonate in free access of air and the product is dissolved in water, a yellow solution of compound (A) is obtained.
    On acidifying the yellow solution with sulphuric acid, compound (B) is crystallize out.

<h3 id="gpm"><u>Gypsum</u></h3>
<p><i>Gypsum is a soft sulphate mineral composed of calcium sulphate dihydrate with the chemical formula 
    C<sub>a</sub>SO<SUB>4</SUB> 2H <sub>2</sub>O.It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the 
    main constituent in many forms of plaster, dry wall and blackboard or sidewalk chalk.Gypsum also crystallizes
    as translucent crystals of selenite.It is composed of two elements; oxygen and sulphur .This mineral can either
    be white in color, gray,brown,orange,green,red,pink,yellow,beige,or it can be colorless, and the streak that it 
    leaves is white.Gypsum is slightly flexible,has low hardness, where it can be scratched by a fingernail, and is sectile
    (can be cut with a Knife).Gypsum is a sedimentory rock, meaning it was formed by cementation at the surface of 
    the earth near bodies of water. 
    <h3 id="gld"><u>Gold</u></h3>
    <p><i>Gold is a soft corrosion-resistant element and is the most malleable and ductile metal.
        Gold is a great thermal and electrical conducter.This element is generally alloyed to increase
        its strength.The melting point of gold is 1337.58 k and contains a boiling point of 3080k in 
        recent years gold has had a significant impact on the economy it's known to rarely decrease
        in price, and many people have lately invested in gold.Gold is a jewelry metal.Gold comes in 
        a few forms white gold,rose gold,and yellow gold white gold was invented in the 19<sup>th</sup>century 
        when it was alloyed with palladium it gained popularity in 1912 in germany as a low-cost substitute for 
        platinum.Gold contains an atomic number of 79 meaning it has 79 protons,and it has an atomic mass of 197
        so if we calculate it's properties (197-79=118) meaning gold has 118 neutrons gold is a precious metal 
        meaning it is used in a range of ways.45% of the world's gold supply is locked and vaulted and is currently 
        in gold bars.Real gold is a very dense metal real gold also doesn't rush or tarnis.In conclusions, we can 
        now understand gold's importance and it's impact on our modern-day economy,society,and politics.Many people
        are not very well educated about this precious element and it's properties leading to many common
        misconceptions.
